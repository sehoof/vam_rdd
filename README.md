Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) - Get your hands dirty now! During reading week in both terms, we aim to reproduce parts of a published paper from a top journal with The Replication Project. These sessions start as well with a 2-hrs intro class to the applied method, and are followed by independent group work and a presentation at the end of the week. The first session will use a paper with a regression discontinuity design, which we will reproduce.
